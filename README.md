## 🔍 Key Steps Implemented

1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**

   * Loaded Netflix dataset from Kaggle
   * Removed duplicates, handled missing values

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

   * Visualized genre distribution, ratings, release years
   * Insights into most popular genres & countries

3. **Recommendation Models**

   * **Content-Based Filtering**: recommends similar movies based on genre, description, etc.
   * **Collaborative Filtering**: uses user-item interactions (ratings, preferences)

4. **Evaluation**

   * Cosine similarity, correlation metrics
   * Sample recommendations for test users

## 🎯 Results

* Content-Based: Suggests movies similar to the one user liked
* Collaborative: Suggests movies based on other users with similar tastes
* Hybrid model gives better accuracy & diversity
